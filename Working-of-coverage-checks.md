There are two coverage checks currently in our code-base:
1. **Code-Climate**: 
* These are the required checks and the failure of these checks would mean the PR is decreasing coverage.
* They provide coverage only for backend.
2. **Codecov**:
* These checks are not required and are only used to generate coverage reports in form of Codecov comments. Hence, the contributor should not worry if the codecov coverage checks are failing (though the code-climate checks should be passing).
* They provide coverage for both backend and frontend.

The checks provided by each service (code-climate and codecov) are:
1. **total-coverage(code-climate) or project(codecov)**: This ensures that the absolute coverage of the code-base does not decrease.
2. **diff-coverage(code-climate) or patch(codecov)**: This ensures the PR is fully tested, i.e it will run coverage only on the changed/added lines.

**What to do if code-climate checks are failing?** 

If code-climate checks are failing, it would only mean the PR is decreasing coverage. If that’s the case, one should follow these steps:
1. Look at the coverage report generated by codecov in the form of comments. There will be 2 comments posted by codecov but look at the one which says “edited”. If neither one has the tag “edited” on it, feel free to look at either one.

For example, look at this one:

But don't look at this one:

2. Click on Impacted Files:

3. Go to the “Files” tab
4. Look at the red and green dot column. Each signify the number of coverage misses and hits respectively:

5. Browse to the file which says there is an increase in red dots or a decrease in green dots.
6. In that file, the red lines denote the coverage misses and green lines denote coverage hits. Add tests for the red lines.
For example, in the screenshot below, line 1429 is an untested line and the others are tested.
