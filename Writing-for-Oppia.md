Thanks for your interest in writing for Oppia! Clear writing reflects clear thinking, and can lead to a large difference in the reader's understanding of a topic.

Since text is used so frequently all over Oppia, there are many ways to help:

  * **Fix problems with the site text.** Various elements of the site aren't as well-explained as they could be (and in some cases aren't explained at all), which leads to confusion on the part of learners and exploration creators. We maintain a list of [open issues](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22TODO%3A+text%22). If there's one that interests you, please add a comment to it to say that you'd like to work on it, in order to avoid duplication with others. You can also log a new issue if you notice something on the site that looks a bit off.

  * **Improve the user or developer documentation.** We maintain [user documentation](https://oppia.github.io/#/) and [developer documentation](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki). It is important that both of these are readable and convey understanding. If you notice a problem, please [log an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new?title=Describe%20your%20feature%20request%20or%20bug%20report%20succinctly&body=If%20you%27d%20like%20to%20propose%20a%20feature,%20describe%20what%20you%27d%20like%20to%20see.%20Mock%20ups%20would%20be%20great!%0A%0AIf%20you%27re%20reporting%20a%20bug,%20please%20be%20sure%20to%20include%20the%20expected%20behaviour,%20the%20observed%20behaviour,%20and%20steps%20to%20reproduce%20the%20problem.%20Console%20copy-pastes%20and%20any%20background%20on%20the%20environment%20would%20also%20be%20helpful.%0A%0AThanks!). You can also suggest a fix by creating a pull request.

  * **Improve an exploration.** Some explorations on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org) have grammatical problems, insufficient clarity, or far too much text. You can identify these explorations, and leave a piece of feedback suggesting changes, or mentioning that you'd be happy to help with improving the wording. If the exploration is community-editable, you could also make the changes directly.

  * **Create an exploration.** If you have a storytelling bent, consider creating an interactive exploration on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org). The editing tools make it possible to bring dry concepts to life by simulating an interactive conversation with a tutor, and you can make these conversations as interesting as you like! We want the learning experience to be one of joy and discovery, and if you can create an exploration which permits this, it would set a great example for other creators.
