Thanks for your interest in contributing art to the Oppia community project! We recognize the importance of great visual design: images can often communicate a message more clearly than words, and they convey a large part of the site's tone and ambience.

Here are some ways in which you can help:

  * **Help create essential art for the site.** We have several needs for artistic assets, but nowhere near enough artists. Oppia's art needs are tracked [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/labels/TODO%3A%20art). If you're interested in any of them, please sign in to GitHub and leave a comment on the appropriate issue, and we'd be happy to help you get started.

  * **Improve an exploration.** Some of the explorations on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org) have lots of text which might be better replaced or supplemented with an image. Others have images that could be improved.You can identify these explorations, and leave a piece of feedback mentioning that you'd be happy to help with improving the images. If the exploration is community-editable, you could also make the changes directly.

If you run into any issues along the way, please feel free to file an issue using our [issue tracker](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues), make a post to our [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev), or send an email to the admin team at admin@oppia.org. We'll do our best to help!
