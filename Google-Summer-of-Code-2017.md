Oppia is excited to be applying for participation in [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)! GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months and be paid a stipend. Students work one-on-one with a mentor of an open source organization in order to implement either a project idea by the organization or a proposal of their own.

Since GSoC 2017 mentoring organizations are not announced until February 27, 2017, it is not known whether Oppia will be participating in Google Summer of Code 2017. This page will be updated accordingly once it is known whether Oppia is participating.

# Students
GSoC is an excellent opportunity for students to get paid to work on an open source project. If you're interested in applying as a student, you should definitely read the following resources:

- [Google Summer of Code student guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/)
- [Google's list of resources](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/)
- [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)

If you're specifically interested in applying to work with Oppia in Google Summer of Code, take a look at one of the project ideas below, which also list the possible mentors for each project. If you're not very familiar with what Oppia is all about (or wish to become familiar with concepts like explorations and interactions), then our [user documentation](http://oppia.github.io/#/) will be very helpful for you! If you're keen on working on a smaller project ahead of Google Summer of Code or even outside of the program, check out [Contributing to Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia).

It will help to take a look at our [developer wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki) to familiarize yourself with our development process before submitting a proposal for a project. Also, check out our various [starter projects](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22starter+project%22) to get an idea of our current work.

Familiarity with JavaScript, Python, and Google App Engine is useful and recommended for most Oppia work. Please see the individual project ideas to determine whether these skills are recommended or required for the project in question.

## Becoming a Mentor

Are you interested in mentoring in Google Summer of Code 2017 for Oppia? Mentoring can be an extremely rewarding experience, though it is a commitment and a responsibility. You can be sure you will learn a lot from your potential mentee. To better understand what mentoring entails, check out this [GSoC mentoring guide](https://flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/).

Please be aware that there are no guarantees Oppia will be accepted into Google Summer of Code, nor that we will have enough students for all mentors to be assigned one. Nevertheless, if you're interested in being a mentor, please email oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com if you're interested in joining!

# Communication

There are several ways to communicate with us (see sections below). Please feel free to also email the organization administrators if you have additional questions and we'll be happy to help:

- Ben Henning henning(dot)benmax(at)gmail(dot)com
- Sean Lip sean(at)seanlip(dot)org

It may help to email the Google Summer of Code mailing list, as well, which is oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com.

## Joining Oppia's Gitter

We don't have an official IRC channel, but we do have a real-time chat channel on [Gitter](
https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat#). You can login using your GitHub account (Gitter will ask to be associated with your GitHub account for authentication) and you will then be able to talk in it.
