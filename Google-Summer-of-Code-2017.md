Oppia is excited to be applying for participation in [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)! GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months and be paid a stipend. Students work one-on-one with a mentor of an open source organization in order to implement either a project idea by the organization or a proposal of their own.

Since GSoC 2017 mentoring organizations are not announced until February 27, 2017, it is not known whether Oppia will be participating in Google Summer of Code 2017. This page will be updated accordingly once it is known whether Oppia is participating.

# Dates and Deadlines
Noteworthy dates for 2017:
- **Jan 19 - Feb 9**: Mentoring organizations apply
- **Feb 27**: Mentoring organizations are announced
- **Mar 20 - Apr 3**: Student application period
- **May 1**: Accepted students announced
- **May 1 - May 30**: Community bonding period
- **May 30 - Aug 29**: Students enjoy the summer by contributing code to their projects
- **Sep 6**: GSoC officially ends

# Students
GSoC is an excellent opportunity for students to get paid to work on an open source project. If you're interested in applying as a student, you should definitely read the following resources:

- [Google Summer of Code student guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/)
- [Google's list of resources](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/)
- [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)

If you're specifically interested in applying to work with Oppia for GSoC, take a look at one of the project ideas below. If you're not very familiar with what Oppia is all about (or wish to become familiar with concepts like explorations and interactions), then our [user documentation](http://oppia.github.io/#/) will be very helpful for you. We'd also recommend that you have a go at playing/creating lessons on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), which hosts an instance of Oppia. If you'd like to work on a smaller coding project ahead of GSoC or even outside of the program, check out [Contributing to Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia) for tips on how to get started.

Before submitting a project proposal, we recommend looking at our [developer wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki) to familiarize yourself with our development process. Also, check out our various [starter projects](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22starter+project%22) -- you may be able to find a smaller issue that interests you, and get some experience with the codebase in the process.

Note: Familiarity with AngularJS (v1), Python and Google App Engine is useful and recommended for most Oppia work. Please see the individual project ideas to determine whether these skills are recommended or required for the project in question.

## GSoC Proposal Template
When proposing a project, please use the following template:

**Project Details**
- Project name
- Why are you interested in working with Oppia?
- What interests you about this project?
- Prior experience (especially with regards to technical skills that are needed for the project)
- Project plan and implementation strategy

**Summer Plans**
- Which timezone(s) will you primarily be in during the summer?
- How much time will you be able to commit to this project?
- What jobs, summer classes, and other obligations might you need to work around? Please be upfront about your any existing commitments you may have.

**Communication**
- What is your preferred method of communication and contact information?
- How often do you plan on communicating with your mentor?

### Notes on the project plan

The project plan is the most important section of the proposal, since it outlines what you'll be doing during the summer. Here's some guidance on what the mentors and organization admins will be looking for in this section:

- **Three clear milestones** explaining the deliverables to be achieved by the end of each coding period. Strong proposals will have clear, concrete and well-defined milestones, whose success can be readily evaluated by an external observer. It's OK to break up a milestone into smaller milestones over smaller timescales, but individual milestones should represent *concrete* deliverables that can be merged into the "develop" branch. Please try to be realistic when setting milestones, and don't over-promise.

- **A technical design and implementation plan**. The project ideas below are annotated with some notes, but please note that these notes are not exclusive and shouldn't serve as a substitute for thinking carefully and critically about the project from first principles. If, in your thinking, you find aspects not mentioned in the notes, feel free to include a discussion of these aspects in your proposal. (For example, certain projects may require a migration of existing production data, and this needs to be accounted for in the project plan.) Strong proposals will demonstrate familiarity with the codebase, a realistic implementation plan, and attention to detail.

- **Mocks or wireframes**, if appropriate. For user-facing projects, we strongly favor proposals that demonstrate an empathy for the user. If you're proposing frontend design mocks, we suggest showing your ideas to your friends and getting their critical feedback, so that you can be confident that others find them intuitive as well. Note that you do not need to make your mocks pixel-perfect, but they should illustrate the primary user journeys clearly enough for us to understand exactly what you're proposing.

## Types of work related to Oppia projects
In order to ensure a well-rounded engineering experience, developers will do some or all of the following depending on their project:
- Meet with their mentors regularly
- Meet with other contributors related to their project area
- Receive code reviews for all code they write for their project
- Write automated tests for their projects
- Create UI mocks (if doing frontend development)
- Write design documents (if implementing large features or introducing new systems)

# Communication

**Chat**

Oppia doesn't have an official IRC channel, but we do have a real-time chat channel on [Gitter](
https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat#). You can login using your GitHub account (Gitter will ask to be associated with your GitHub account for authentication) and you will then be able to talk in it.

**Email**

If you have questions, please send them to the Oppia GSoC mentors mailing list at oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com. Please be specific when asking questions; this makes it easier for us to help you.

## Becoming a Mentor

Are you interested in mentoring in Google Summer of Code 2017 for Oppia? Mentoring can be an extremely rewarding experience, though it is a commitment and a responsibility. To better understand what mentoring entails, check out this [GSoC mentoring guide](https://flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/).

Please be aware that there are no guarantees Oppia will be accepted into GSoC, nor that we will have enough students for all mentors to be assigned one. Nevertheless, if you're interested in being a mentor, please email oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com if you're interested in joining!
