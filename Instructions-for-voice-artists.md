Thank you for your interest in doing voiceovers for Oppia lessons, in order to help students who face language barriers! 

This page explains the process of adding voiceovers to a lesson. If you run into any problems along the way, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us by emailing Angeli, Sandeep or Sean.

## Getting started

1. Register for an account on the Oppia site, and make a note of your username.
2. Contact Angeli or Sean for information about which lessons need voiceovers. Please include your Oppia username when contacting them, so that they can assign you to a lesson.
3. When you have been assigned as the voice artist for a lesson, you’ll receive an email with a link to that lesson!

## How do I get to the lesson?

1. The email contains a link to a lesson. Click this link to visit the lesson’s editor interface, and then log in via the top-right button if you haven’t already.
2. Alternatively, you can check your creator dashboard on Oppia to see the lessons you are assigned as a voice actor for. To do this

      i. Log in to [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org)

     ii. Click on the top right corner of the page and select the Creator Dashboard option.

    iii. Once the Creator Dashboard page is loaded, click the lesson you want to translate. This will take you to its editor page.


## What should I do when I’m on the exploration editor page?

1. Make sure that you are logged in (you can check that your avatar shows up at the top-right of the navigation bar to verify).

2. The editor page contains a special tab for voice-artists and translators. Open this tab by clicking the ![Mic](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DDb_FsYAy0kOUOKe2ULYcfDcoH0SNqwltI4gAxb7GGrIEeOxg6orUVrpgfsqBjy3rWmVFgp9UD5tiSZkJOlqiCOBW7fqJrpLgmmEzBmJMXGJjO9OEINECk-3FEO1zo2tTUdvH4Ca) (Mic icon) from the navigation bar (shown in white, in the image below).

3. In the translation settings and overview box at the top, select the language that you want to do voiceovers for. There is a progress bar below that dropdown; it will show you how much of the lesson has been covered with voiceovers for that language. (See the red box below.)

4. Each Oppia lesson is divided into individual “cards”. These cards are shown in the Exploration Overview graph on the right. You can navigate between the different cards by clicking on them in the Exploration Overview. The cards that still need work are the ones shown as yellow or red.
  
    In each card, there are several pieces of text that need voiceovers. You can browse through these by clicking on the tabs in the section on the left (shown by the blue box in the screenshot below).
    The meanings of the different tabs are as follows:
    * Content: The main text of the lesson card.
    * Feedback: The feedback that a student receives after providing an answer to a question. We try to give specific guidance if a student has gotten a question incorrect, like a tutor would.
    * Hints: The hints given to the student if they are stuck.
    * Solution: An explanation of how to solve the question.

    Note that some of the tabs may have multiple pieces of text; in such cases, each piece of text will need a separate voiceover. The main tabs to focus on are the ones with a yellow or red stripe at the top.

5. After you have selected a piece of text, you can record/upload audio files using the audio bar at the bottom (see screenshot below). Once you have done that, the audio file gets matched with the piece of text that is currently active. This will update the progress counter!
