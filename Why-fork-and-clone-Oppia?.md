Forking a repository creates a copy of the repository on your account. The _Fork_ button is present on the right side of the repository name. See below,

After you Fork the repository, you can see the forked repository under your user name.

Now, you would clone this repository from your account (hence, fork and clone). We have established a very clean setup now. We can make any changes to this repository and then make a pull request for getting it merged in original repository. 

Just one thing is missing, we want to keep this repository synced with original repository and we want to make pull requests from our repository to original repository. We use _develop_ branch to keep the sync and cut out a branch from develop to make changes and create pull request.
