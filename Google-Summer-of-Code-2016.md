Oppia is excited to be applying for participation in [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)! GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months and be paid a stipend. Students work one-on-one with a mentor of an open source organization in order to implement either a project proposed by the organization (see Oppia's proposed projects below) or a proposal of their own.

Since GSoC 2016 mentoring organizations are not announced until February 29, 2016, it is not known whether Oppia will be able to participate in Google Summer of Code 2016. This page will be updated accordingly once it is known whether Oppia is participating.

# Students
GSoC is an excellent opportunity for students to get paid to work on an open source project. If you're interested in apply as a student, you should definitely read the following resources:

- [Google Summer of Code student guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/)
- [Google's list of resources](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/)
- [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)

If you're specifically interested in applying to work with Oppia in Google Summer of Code, take a look at one of the prospective projects below, which also list the possible mentors for each project. Feel free to contact your mentor ahead of time or email oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com. If you're keen on working on a smaller project ahead of Google Summer of Code or even outside of the program, check out [Contributing to Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Android app to enable learning-on-the-go


## Creator dashboard

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Potential mentor(s)**: Sean Lip

### Summary

Oppia's approach to creating educational content is incremental -- that is, the content is not created all at once, but is improved over time based on answers and feedback from students. Analysis of these answers can help lesson creators detect and respond to common misconceptions, so that students who encounter similar issues in the future can receive better feedback from Oppia.

The purpose of this GSoC project is to implement a creator dashboard that allows lesson creators to see, at a glance, completion rates, common student misconceptions, and student-submitted feedback for their lessons -- and to make it easy for creators to take action on this information. A design project for this page is currently underway, and we expect to have some preliminary mocks developed for this page by the time GSoC starts, but these are likely to undergo further iterations as we make progress on implementation and usability testing. If you are interested, we welcome your participation in the design process!

Expected results: A page in Oppia that displays the above information for creators in a way that is easy to understand and that also makes it easy for them to take action. Some backend computation would also be needed to aggregate the relevant data and keep it up to date.

### Required skills/knowledge

Familiarity with Python and AngularJS; ability to accurately implement UIs based on designers' mocks. Also useful (but not required): ability to create and edit design mocks (e.g. using Sketch).

Since this is a full-stack project, you might also find the [Overview of the Codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Overview-of-the-Oppia-codebase) wiki page helpful in order to get a sense of how the Oppia stack works.


## Making it possible to submit and prioritize requests for learning material


## Making Oppia usable offline (and being more lightweight in transmitting data)


## Applying machine learning to code interaction training and generalizing
