Oppia is excited to be applying for participation in [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months and be paid a stipend. Students work one-on-one with a mentor of an open source organization in order to implement either a project proposed by the organization (see Oppia's proposed projects below) or a proposal of their own.

Since GSoC 2016 mentoring organizations are not announced until February 29, 2016, it is not known whether Oppia will be able to participate in Google Summer of Code 2016. This page will be updated accordingly once it is known whether Oppia is participating.
