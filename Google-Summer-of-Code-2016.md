Oppia is excited to be applying for participation in [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)! GSoC is a global program which offers post-secondary students an opportunity to discover and work with open source organizations over the course of 3 months and be paid a stipend. Students work one-on-one with a mentor of an open source organization in order to implement either a project proposed by the organization (see [Oppia's proposed projects](#oppias-project-ideas)) or a proposal of their own.

Since GSoC 2016 mentoring organizations are not announced until February 29, 2016, it is not known whether Oppia will be able to participate in Google Summer of Code 2016. This page will be updated accordingly once it is known whether Oppia is participating.

## Becoming a Mentor

Are you interested in mentoring in Google Summer of Code 2016 for Oppia? Mentoring can be an extremely rewarding experience, though it is a commitment and a responsibility. You can be sure you will learn a lot from your potential mentee. To learn more about what mentoring entails, check out this [GSoC mentoring guide](https://flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/).

Please be aware that there are no guarantees Oppia will be accepted into Google Summer of Code, nor that we will have enough students for all mentors to be assigned one. Nevertheless, if you're interested in being a mentor, please email oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com if you're interested in joining!

# Communication

There are several ways to communicate with us (see sections below). Please feel free to also email the organization administrators if you have additional questions and we'll be happy to help:

- Ben Henning <henning(dot)benmax(at)gmail(dot)com>
- Sean Lip <sean(at)seanlip(dot)org>

It may help to email the Google Summer of Code mailing list, as well, which is oppia-gsoc-mentors@googlegroups.com.

## Joining Oppia's Gitter

We don't have an official IRC channel, but we do have a real-time chat channel through Gitter. Joining our Gitter chat is easily. Simply head to the following link:

https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat#

You can login using your GitHub account (Gitter will ask to be associated with your GitHub account for authentication) and you will then be able to talk in it.

## Oppia's Developer Mailing List

You should also join Oppia's developer mailing list: oppia-dev@googlegroups.com. You can join by going to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-dev and requesting to join the group. A group manager will need to approve the request (usually happens within a couple of hours).

Nearly all contributors to Oppia (past and present) are in this mailing list, so it's a fantastic place to ask questions that the entire team will see. All developers working on Oppia are highly recommended to join this mailing list, as major announcements are listed here (including early details on future releases and major work being done across the project).

# Oppia's Project Ideas

We have several projects that will have significant impact on Oppia and we feel would make excellent Google Summer of Code projects. This is the specific list we are outlining for GSoC, but there are many more project ideas being discussed on the team.

Feel free to suggest your own or look at our various [starter projects](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22starter+project%22) to help generate ideas for new projects, if none of the below interest you. We're also happy to discuss new ideas that you'd like to implement, outside of the projects listed below or our existing starter projects.

Finally, be aware that the projects below may either seem larger than they are or will be sized down once a student is paired with one. These projects were picked because they were self-contained, high-impact projects. Most of them involve end-to-end development, which can be very hard to do within only a summer of work. We have ranked each project based on our assumed difficulty; the projects themselves should be scoped based on students' applications and discussion with the corresponding mentors once the summer begins.

Many of the projects below involve significant work in either Oppia's frontend, backend, or both. It is very helpful to look at [the overview of Oppia's codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Overview-of-the-Oppia-codebase) as a reference.



## Making Oppia usable offline and being more lightweight in transmitting data

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Potential mentor(s)**: Ben Henning

### Summary

This is a two-part project. Oppia currently requires users to be connected to the internet at all times while playing explorations. Furthermore, Oppia sends quite a lot of data across the network while playing explorations or visiting the website in general. Both of these have negative effects on user's experience on the site. It also might make Oppia difficult or impossible to use for many users who are on poorer connections. To be able to use Oppia without much data transfer or even offline completely would have huge implications for millions of people, if not more.

The first part of this project involves allowing explorations to be played without an internet connection. This is a multi-step problem. While playing an exploration, there are many things that happen, including:
- Statistics recording
- Answer classification
- Response selection
- State transitions

Most of these now happen in the frontend, however, there are still a few aspects of the communication between the frontend and backend that need to be changed in order to allow offline playing. Furthermore, there's no concept of persistent frontend storage currently.

The second part of this project is decreasing the amount of data Oppia sends between the backend and frontend. Oppia was not originally designed with mobile or poor internet connections in mind. There have been recent efforts by contributors to minify the CSS and JS resources of Oppia, though these are just stepping stones in the longer strategy of making Oppia more efficient bandwidth-wise for users.

### Required skills/knowledge
Required:
- Familiarity with AngularJS
- Familiarity with Python
- Familiarity with Google app engine

Recommended:
- Code investigation skills
- Familiarity with frontend data storage solutions
- Understanding of RESTful APIs

Both parts of this project involve a lot of investigation, since you will need to figure out which parts of the protocol need to be adjusted in order to facilitate offline playing or how to optimize the protocol or other parts of the Oppia stack to reduce the amount of data sent across it.



## Making it possible to submit and prioritize requests for learning material

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Potential mentor(s)**: Ben Henning

### Summary

Currently, https://oppia.org serves as a repository of almost random explorations users have created. Although it's fantastic users create these explorations, we think Oppia will be a lot more effective to both learners and exploration creators if there is some way for people to submit requests for new explorations and have creators address those requests by directly creating the corresponding exploration(s).

This project involves writing a system for creating, listing, and addressing requests for new content. Users should be able to see and search for content requests, be able to create a new request for content (including a brief description), and vote on existing requests. Creators will be able to use the same searching functionality to find top-ranked requests and address them by listing a specific exploration or collection which they feel satisfies the request. It's not yet clear what the exact flow of this should be; we will leave it up to the student's proposal to clarify how they feel learners and creators should interact when addressing content requests. Some things to consider in this area include:

- Should any creator be able to address any request (even very popular ones)?
- Should the request be closed when an exploration/collection is associated with a request?
- Should explorations and interactions even be associated with requests?
- Should requests allow back-and-forth discussion among the community?
- Should the author of the request be responsible for closing the request when an exploration/collection is made which satisfies it?

Those are just a few questions to get started thinking about the system.

### Required skills/knowledge

This is an end-to-end project and involves quite a lot of hands-on work with both frontend and backend code.

Required:
- Familiarity with Python
- Familiarity with AngularJS

Recommended:
- Familiarity with Google app engine (we use a NoSQL data store)
- Familiarity with creating mocks with programs such as sketch (definitely not a requirement, but it will help)

You will be expected to create mocks (even if they're just drawings on paper) and a design document outlining the technical changes needed in the frontend and backend for implementing this system. You will be working with people across the team since this project is multi-disciplinary.



## Creator dashboard

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Potential mentor(s)**: Sean Lip

### Summary

Oppia's approach to creating educational content is incremental -- that is, the content is not created all at once, but is improved over time based on answers and feedback from students. Analysis of these answers can help lesson creators detect and respond to common misconceptions, so that students who encounter similar issues in the future can receive better feedback from Oppia.

The purpose of this GSoC project is to implement a creator dashboard that allows lesson creators to see, at a glance, completion rates, common student misconceptions, and student-submitted feedback for their lessons -- and to make it easy for creators to take action on this information. A design project for this page is currently underway, and we expect to have some preliminary mocks developed for this page by the time GSoC starts, but these are likely to undergo further iterations as we make progress on implementation and usability testing. If you are interested, we welcome your participation in the design process!

Expected results: A page in Oppia that displays the above information for creators in a way that is easy to understand and that also makes it easy for them to take action. Some backend computation would also be needed to aggregate the relevant data and keep it up to date.

### Required skills/knowledge

Familiarity with Python and AngularJS; ability to accurately implement UIs based on designers' mocks. Also useful (but not required): ability to create and edit design mocks (e.g. using Sketch).

Since this is a full-stack project, you might also find the [Overview of the Codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Overview-of-the-Oppia-codebase) wiki page helpful in order to get a sense of how the Oppia stack works.

## Android app to enable learning-on-the-go

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Potential mentor(s)**: Ben Henning

### Summary

The world is increasingly becoming a mobile-driven environment. There are well over one billion users in the world with smart phones, currently. Although Oppia is a response website for learners, there is much to gain by having a dedicated Android app. Maintaining a responsive website is challenging and there are almost certainly going to be issues when viewing the site on different devices.

This project will introduce a dedicated mobile interface for Oppia, through either web views, targeted styling for the web application, or a native Android interface. This mobile interface will make it easier for users to access their profile, browse the gallery, and play through explorations.

Expected results: An app which allows users to access primary portions of Oppia's website (the profile page, gallery, and learner view) and be able to play through an exploration.

### Required skills/knowledge

Required:
- Java and extensive comfort writing Java applications
- Familiarity with Angular JS: the developer working on this project will need to understand how Oppia's frontend works

Recommended:
- Android development experience
- Familiarity with Google app engine: depending on how the Android application is implemented, understanding how app engine serves content may be critical for implementing the app (we use Python in our app engine implementation)
- Familiarity with RESTful APIs



## Applying machine learning to code interaction training and generalizing

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Potential mentor(s)**: Ben Henning

### Summary

Since Oppia needs to be a smart tutor which provides personalized feedback to learners, machine learning has a great potential application to Oppia. There are some efforts into allowing creators to train Oppia to respond a certain way in their explorations based on user answers. This support is not yet enabled as of the beginning of Google Summer of Code, but is being actively developed and can facilitate the work on this project. It will also be turned on for the public to use before the end of summer.

The new functionality introduces a training interface in the exploration editor wherein creators can see previous user answers, then select which response Oppia should use if it encounters that answer again (or the creator can create a new response, instead). We then train a classifier in the background so that Oppia can hopefully place new answers in the correct response before the creator teaches it to do so. The training interface will be available for a few interactions, but the machine learning part will only be available for text input. Although text input with machine learning is a fascinating and highly useful topic, this project focuses on applying machine learning for training our code evaluation interactions, instead.

The code evaluation interaction allows learners to type in code in order to match some sort of output, avoid an error, or match specific code. The code is evaluated in the frontend, but the learner's answer is stored in the backend. Python is the only supported language, though we will definitely be adding more languages in the future.

This project involves figuring out a way to cluster together similar pieces of code (though not exactly the same) and then use that to train a classification model that can predict which cluster a new piece of code belongs to. Originally, members of the Oppia team were considering to integrate [OverCode](http://people.csail.mit.edu/elg/overcode) and use that, though there were some technical concerns with how it would integrate with Oppia. Using an existing library is completely fine for this project and even encouraged. The complexity of this project is discovering a library, integrating it, and making sure it practically works well.

At the end of the project, creators will be able to train Oppia to respond to certain types of code inputted by learners. Oppia will be able to encounter new pieces of code it has yet see and intelligently classify them into previously learned buckets, if that new piece of code is sufficiently similar semantically to previously taught bits of code.

### Required skills/knowledge
Required:
- Understanding machine learning concepts, including clustering and statistical classification techniques
- Python

Recommended:
- Google app engine
- NoSQL storage systems
- RESTful APIs

Students working on this project will need to write up a design document explaining which library/libraries they plan on integrating, as well as an overall solution to solving the clustering problem. Some emphasis will be placed on ensuring it will work within the answer classification infrastructure, though there are many members of the Oppia team which will assist with explaining this to the student.
