## Instructions on when to notify @oppia/qa-team
You can notify the QA team using @oppia/qa-team (consists of Akshay, Vibhor, Nitish and Nithesh).   Here is when we would like you to notify us using this alias (on either PRs or issues). 
- If a serious bug is reported, which affects our end users, please escalate ASAP to the QA team.
- If there are bugs filed during release testing, please notify us.
- For PRs, which add new core user journeys to Oppia, please notify us so that we can add it to the list of things we manually test every release. This would typically include any fairly large feature implemented. Some examples include "Add translation for a card" or "search for an exploration in the library and play it".
- For PRs which add smaller functional capabilities to Oppia, we need to be notified. We keep track of our end-to-end testing coverage, and try to make sure that all of these functional capabilities have representative tests in the automated test suite. This would include smaller features too, for example "Add exploration to play later list", "Rate an exploration" as well as some larger features like "Add a hint to a state", "Reply to feedback threads". 

This will help us out to maintain the quality of Oppia's codebase! Please take note of these instructions.
