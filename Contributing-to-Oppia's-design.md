Thanks for your interest in helping out with Oppia's design! Design is an important part of the Oppia project, since we want the learning experience to be enjoyable and encourage focus, and we want the exploration creation experience to be intuitive and easy.

The following instructions explain how to get started, and how to find a fun design project to work on:

### Getting started ###

1. If you'd like to set up a local copy of Oppia on your system, please follow the instructions in [this section](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-things-up) of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

2. Pick a project! We have a number of starter projects available for [UI, interaction and visual design](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/labels/TODO%3A%20design%20%28UI%2Finteraction%29), and some harder ones for [UX design](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/labels/TODO%3A%20design%20%28UX%29) of larger features. We recommend starting with one of the former projects, since they're generally smaller in scope, but you're welcome to take on a UX design challenge if you'd like. Also, if you notice something on the site that looks a bit off (and that you'd also like to work on), please feel free to log a [new issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new?title=Describe%20your%20feature%20request%20or%20bug%20report%20succinctly&body=If%20you%27d%20like%20to%20propose%20a%20feature,%20describe%20what%20you%27d%20like%20to%20see.%20Mock%20ups%20would%20be%20great!%0A%0AIf%20you%27re%20reporting%20a%20bug,%20please%20be%20sure%20to%20include%20the%20expected%20behaviour,%20the%20observed%20behaviour,%20and%20steps%20to%20reproduce%20the%20problem.%20Console%20copy-pastes%20and%20any%20background%20on%20the%20environment%20would%20also%20be%20helpful.%0A%0AThanks!).

3. Once you find a project that interests you, please add a comment to say that you'd like to work on it, in order to avoid others unnecessarily duplicating your work.

4. If you run into any issues, or if you'd like us to recommend a design project to work on, please contact **@amitdeutsch** or send an email to the [developers' mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev), and we'd be happy to help you get started. There are many design projects currently available to work on, and we'd love to try and find something that you'd enjoy.

### How issues are categorized ###

  * **User interface and visual design.** This involves determining the positioning, colors, text and shapes of elements on the screen, or creating art assets for the site. If you're new to the codebase, these tend to be great starter projects, since they don't require too much context. We maintain a comprehensive list of [open UI/art issues](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/labels/TODO%3A%20design%20%28UI%2Finteraction%29). 

  * **UX design.** This involves conducting research into understanding the problem, figuring out the user needs and critical user journeys, and designing the overall flow of an experience. Similar to the above, we also maintain a list of [open UX issues](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/labels/TODO%3A%20design%20%28UX%29).

  * **Usability testing.** Oppia relies heavily on usability testing and feedback to validate our design ideas. This often involves taking a design prototype, sitting down with new or existing users, and making notes on stumbling blocks and confusion points. Such feedback is very useful to the designers and developers, and helps ensure that Oppia continues to be easy to use as its functionality increases. If you'd like to help, please contact the [Oppia dev team](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev), and we'd be happy to help you get started (probably by matching you with a designer to work together with).
