Thanks for your interest in helping out with Oppia's design! We place a large importance on design in this project, since we want the learning experience to be enjoyable and encourage focus, and we want the exploration creation experience to be intuitive and easy.

Currently, we're very short of designers on the core team, so any help you can provide would be very welcome. Please contact @amitdeutsch or @seanlip, or send an email to the [developers' mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev), and we'd be very happy to help you get started.

Here are some ways in which you can help:

  * **Art**. Please see the [Contribution Guidelines for Artists](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-art-to-Oppia).

  * **User interface and visual design.** This involves determining the positioning, colors, text and shapes of elements on the screen. We maintain a list of [open issues](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22TODO%3A+UI%2Fvisual+design%22). If there's one that interests you, please add a comment to it to say that you'd like to work on it, in order to avoid duplication with others. You can also log a [new issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new?title=Describe%20your%20feature%20request%20or%20bug%20report%20succinctly&body=If%20you%27d%20like%20to%20propose%20a%20feature,%20describe%20what%20you%27d%20like%20to%20see.%20Mock%20ups%20would%20be%20great!%0A%0AIf%20you%27re%20reporting%20a%20bug,%20please%20be%20sure%20to%20include%20the%20expected%20behaviour,%20the%20observed%20behaviour,%20and%20steps%20to%20reproduce%20the%20problem.%20Console%20copy-pastes%20and%20any%20background%20on%20the%20environment%20would%20also%20be%20helpful.%0A%0AThanks!) if you notice something on the site that looks a bit off.

  * **UX and interaction design.** This involves conducting research into understanding the problem, figuring out the user needs and critical user journeys, and designing the overall flow of an experience. Similar to the above, we also maintain a list of [open issues](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22TODO%3A+UX%2Finteraction+design%22). If you're interested in any of these, please sign into GitHub and add a comment saying that you'd like to work on the issue, so that others don't duplicate your work.

  * **Usability testing.** Oppia relies heavily on usability testing and feedback to validate our design ideas. This often involves taking a design prototype, sitting down with new or existing users, and making notes on stumbling blocks and confusion points. Such feedback is very useful to the designers and developers, and helps ensure that Oppia continues to be easy to use as its functionality increases.
