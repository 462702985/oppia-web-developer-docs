Thanks for your interest in teaching with Oppia! The [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org) site aims to make it easy for you to help other people learn new things. It also provides editing tools and an open commons, so that your work can reach lots of people. We hope that this will raise the bar for education globally, and improve the learning experience for students who don't have access to expert tutors. You can read more about the Oppia project on our [GitHub page](https://oppia.github.io/#/WhatIsOppia).

Here's how you can help:

  * You could create a new exploration on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org) that helps to explain a difficult concept, or a useful skill. If you'd like to do this as part of a larger effort, you might also be interested in our [Teach with Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/teach) program.

  * You could edit an existing exploration on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), or suggest a change to one, in order to make it clearer and more useful for learners.

  * You could make a really good learning experience that combines multiple Oppia explorations and/or other resources to help someone effectively learn something. If you do this, let us know by posting to the [Oppia forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia), so that others can be inspired by your work!

  * When creating an exploration, you might find that you would be able to convey the intuition better if only you had a particular type of functionality -- but alas, Oppia may not offer it. If that happens, please [log an issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/new?title=Describe%20your%20feature%20request%20or%20bug%20report%20succinctly&body=If%20you%27d%20like%20to%20propose%20a%20feature,%20describe%20what%20you%27d%20like%20to%20see.%20Mock%20ups%20would%20be%20great!%0A%0AIf%20you%27re%20reporting%20a%20bug,%20please%20be%20sure%20to%20include%20the%20expected%20behaviour,%20the%20observed%20behaviour,%20and%20steps%20to%20reproduce%20the%20problem.%20Console%20copy-pastes%20and%20any%20background%20on%20the%20environment%20would%20also%20be%20helpful.%0A%0AThanks!), so that we can consider it for future development cycles.

  * Currently, there aren't enough connections between explorations. In order to make Oppia more useful to learners, we'd like to group some of our existing explorations into collections, and this functionality is currently in development. We are looking for different use cases to guide this work, so if you would like to create a series of explorations and have thoughts on how you'd like to link them together, they would be very welcome.

  * The Oppia team loves feedback which helps us improve the site and its content. If you try out an exploration with others, and notice any problems or have ideas for improvement, please don't hesitate to [let us know](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-dev)!
