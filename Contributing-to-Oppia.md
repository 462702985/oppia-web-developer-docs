Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia project! There are many ways to help, and not all of them are technical. For instance, you could create a new exploration on [Oppia.org](https://www.oppia.org), or fix a bug in the [Oppia codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/).

It's OK if you're new to open source, or if you're still a student -- many of our contributors are, too! If you care about education, and want to help more people around the world learn things better, we'd be delighted to have you on the team. For certain roles, we may also be able to provide mentorship and support, especially if this is your first time contributing to an open source project.

The following pages contain information about specific ways to help out, depending on what sorts of things you'd like to do.
