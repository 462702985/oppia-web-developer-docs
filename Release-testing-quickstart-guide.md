Testing features is one of the easiest ways to get familiar with the website and the various features. It makes it easy to then understand which parts of the code link to which component, and thus can improve your understanding of the codebase.

At Oppia, we do monthly releases and during each release, we do a manual testing of the core user journeys we have. Anyone is welcome to participate in the release testing!

Here is a quick start guide that could help you get involved with the testing:
- Contact Nithesh (at nithesh2108@gmail.com). Hangouts or email is fine. Just mention that you would be interested to participate in the testing.
- Typically during the first week of the month, you’ll get an email from the release testing coordinator for the month mentioning the dates for the current release’s testing phase.
    - If it is your first time doing the testing, you will be paired up with a tester who has done testing multiple times before. If you run into any issues while testing the feature, you can get in touch with them or the testing coordinator. 
- This doc outlines the [Critical User Journeys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3MG2MVh_7m7B0wIlZb7sAcoyUdY0zq7a1JEFtwYBjI/edit#heading=h.gs2e2lh85so7). You will be assigned a few of these to test during the release testing phase.
    - You can go through these and try some of them yourself.
- Go through this [guide for release testing](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Guide-for-release-testing). It outlines many common things to look out for while testing.
