Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia project, and making it easier for students to learn online in an effective and enjoyable way!

There are lots of ways to help out, from joining our team of lesson creators to fixing a bug in the [codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/). Don't worry if you're new to "open source", or if you're still a student -- many of our contributors are, too, and we'd be happy to provide mentorship and support if this is your first time contributing to an open source project. The main thing is that you care deeply about helping people around the world to learn things better, and that you're responsible and reliable.

To make it easier to get started, we've catalogued some of the different ways to help out. Please feel free to take a look through them, and see if any interest you:

  * [Coders](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#setting-things-up)
  * [Instructional designers and storytellers](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Teaching-with-Oppia)

  * [Designers and artists](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-to-Oppia%27s-design)

If you run into any problems, you can check out the [user documentation](http://oppia.github.io/) or post to our [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev). Feel free to drop into our [Gitter chat channel](https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat) to say hello, too :)

Finally, if, after reading the above links, you'd like to help, but aren't sure how -- don't worry! The Oppia project is very multi-faceted, and we'd be glad to help you find something to do that matches your interests and skills. Just write to us at [oppia-dev@](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-dev), or at [admin@oppia.org](mailto:admin@oppia.org) and tell us a bit about yourself and what you'd like to do. We'll do our best to help you get started!


## Oppia Social Meets
At Oppia, we believe in socializing with our contributors. Many of us are students, recent graduates, and teachers from different corners of the world, and a social meet is a great way to help all the members of Oppia feel more connected. Following this idea, we're organizing social meets, AMAs, webinars and talks on alternate weekends. Make sure you check out the calendar of events below and wave “Hi” at the meet!
