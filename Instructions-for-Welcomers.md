Thank you for taking out your valuable time to be a part of the office hours initiative. The initiative primarily aims at welcoming new contributors and helping them get started with the Oppia project. It's sometimes hard for new contributors to get a grasp of how things work initially, thus it would be great if we could help them begin to contribute in the right way. 

## Scheduling

### Rota: 

| Times (UTC)        | 00:30 - 01:00           | 08:30 - 09:30  | 16:30 - 17:00 | 21:30 - 22:00
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:  
| Tuesday     | [Rajat Patwa](https://github.com/razat249) | [Abraham Mgowano](https://github.com/amgowano) | [Sourav Badami](https://github.com/souravbadami) | -
| Wednesday      |   [Andrew Low](https://github.com/kahkhang)  |   - | [Avijit Gupta](https://github.com/526avijitgupta) | [Jacob Davis](https://github.com/jacobdavis11)
| Sunday |  [Dzeudjouo Herve](https://github.com/hervephp)     |    - | [Avijit Gupta](https://github.com/526avijitgupta) | [Kristin Anthony](https://github.com/anthkris)

We’ve tried to allot the hours in such a manner so that they fit into each welcomer’s preferred hours (as indicated on the survey). Please try and stick to the rota, otherwise new contributors may turn up expecting help and be disappointed when there’s no one around.

If you have any issues with the rota, please contact - [Avijit Gupta](https://github.com/526avijitgupta)

## Guidelines for answering questions:

1. New contributors cannot be expected to always ask good queries, so please be patient and try to understand what they want to convey! Keep in mind that they might not be well versed with the community, or even open source in general.

2. If you find yourself repeatedly answering the same queries, then it’s probably best to add them to the [FAQs](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) if you find them to be general. Feel free to cluster multiple queries into a single FAQ (e.g. variants of “what do I do if the installation process doesn’t work?”).

3. If the question is already answered in the FAQ or other wiki documentation (e.g. “how do I get Oppia installed?”), it’s best to point the new contributor to the relevant docs, and be clear that they are welcome to ask again if they’ve already looked at those docs and still need help. 

4. If you don’t know the answer to a question (e.g. - Installation errors), just try and give it your best shot! If it still remains unresolved, then you could probably just mention any other mentor who you think is better equipped to help in such a case. You might also want to post on the [welcomers’ Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppia-welcomers) in case someone else can offer assistance.
