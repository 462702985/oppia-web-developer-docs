## How to join the Dev Workflow Team?

* **If you’re interested in joining the team, please ensure that you are a part of at most one team at Oppia.** This is to ensure that you’re able to devote sufficient time to each team.
* Go through the team’s mission, ongoing workflow and the project on GitHub [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/projects/23).
* **You need to solve a couple of dev-workflow issues before being inducted as a permanent member of the team.** Feel free to assign yourself any project-specific starter issue here. When you create a PR for any of these issues, ask **@apb7** for review.
* After you’ve successfully fixed two dev-workflow-specific starter issues, follow these steps:
  * Ping **@apb7** to make you a member of the dev-workflow-team.
  * Ping **@apb7** to assign you one of the sub-missions of the Team. If the sub-mission is already being led by any team member, please ping them for suggested work. The following are the current sub leads:
    * **Apurv**: Builds and Review Workflow
    * **Rishav**: Oppiabot and Setup issues
    * **Anubhav**: Optimize speed of scripts
    * **Yash**: Tracking and adding new lint checks to the codebase.
  * Ping **@apb7** to extend the team meeting invites to you. Please RSVP to them as soon as possible.
  * Ping **@apb7** to add you to the Dev Workflow Team Hangouts group. The Team usually has quick discussions here.
  * Ping **@lilithxxx** to assign you a rota for tracking setup issues, here.
  * Subscribe to both, CircleCI and Travis build notifications. Please follow this:
    * CircleCI: Login to CircleCI using your GitHub account and go to this link. There you’ll find an option to follow oppia/oppia.  
    * Travis: Make a PR adding your email id to .travis.yml similar to this PR.
  * You’re all set now -- start working on the assigned sub mission. This generally involves fixing devflow issues on GitHub.

## Instructions for existing team members
Jot down the issues faced by developers related to developer-workflow in the [setup-issues spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pKN1otvhaI8IYlNj79MX_qxArbD4p4L-CdsnQT022Pc/edit?usp=sharing
) with the possible solutions (if known) from which they will be noted in the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Troubleshooting) of the wiki.

### Tasks:
* Look through the gitter channel, the mailing list and all issues/PRs where the dev-flow team (@dev-workflow-team) is tagged.
* If a setup issue is seen more than 2 times in the codebase then open a new issue with the label ‘setup issues’ in github.

#### [@apb7 + @lilithxxx + @anubhavsinha98 + @YashJipkate]: 
_If a new issue comes in_, clearly explain the issue faced by the developer with its possible solutions (if known) in the above issues spreadsheet.
If the issue is solved by you:
* **Update the troubleshooting page of the wiki.**
* Remove the issue from the spreadsheet after its been written down in the wiki.

#### [@lilithxxx]:

* Monitor that the solutions of all setup issues are indeed jotted down in the wiki.
