Jot down the issues faced by developers related to developer-workflow in the [setup-issues spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pKN1otvhaI8IYlNj79MX_qxArbD4p4L-CdsnQT022Pc/edit?usp=sharing
) with the possible solutions (if known) from which they will be noted in the [Troubleshooting page](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Troubleshooting) of the wiki.

### Tasks:
* Look through the gitter channel, the mailing list and all issues/PRs where a dev-flow member is mentioned.
* If a setup issue is seen more than 2 times in the codebase then open a new issue with the label ‘setup issues’ in github.

#### [@apb7 + @lilithxxx + @anubhavsinha98 + @YashJipkate]: 
_If a new issue comes in_, clearly explain the issue faced by the developer with its possible solutions (if known) in the above issues spreadsheet.
If the issue is solved by you:
* _Update the troubleshooting page of the wiki._
* Remove the issue from the spreadsheet after its been written down in the wiki.

2. Send a ping/email to the member reminding him/her of the rota if it has been missed.

#### [@lilithxxx]: 
* If the issue is solved by someone other than a dev-flow member, write down the issue with its solution in the troubleshooting page of the wiki so that other contributor does not face the same problem.
* Monitor that the solutions of all setup issues are indeed jotted down in the wiki.
