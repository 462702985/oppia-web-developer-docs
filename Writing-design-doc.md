### Instructions
When writing design docs at Oppia, please consider using this [design doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMivKj5uWkOkj4AB684JVJslAe49gSskZ-VsyUjgPN4/edit). This will ensure that all the necessary information for the project is documented in a central location, and enable project reviews to be done effectively.

More specifically, here’s how to get started:

1. Make a copy of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMivKj5uWkOkj4AB684JVJslAe49gSskZ-VsyUjgPN4/edit).
2. Delete the top "instructions" box.
3. Fill in all the sections with details pertaining to your feature/project (you can remove the existing text, which is just meant to help you get started). For sections that are not required for the particular project you’re working on, write a short explanation of why they’re not required, rather than deleting them altogether.
