Oppia is planning to participate in first year of [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/). The program connects open source organizations with technical writers, who then work on 3 or 6 month long projects, and then can receive a paid stipend. The technical writers work closely with two or more mentors on finishing a project idea by the organization, or a proposal of their own.

Also, please note that acceptance into Season of Docs isn't a prerequisite for [becoming an Oppia contributor](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki). The Oppia project is run by the community for the community, and we warmly welcome anyone who'd like to help out!
