Oppia is planning to participate in first year of [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/). The program connects open source organizations with technical writers, who then work on 3 or 6 month long projects, and then can receive a paid stipend. The technical writers work closely with two or more mentors on finishing a project idea by the organization, or a proposal of their own.

Also, please note that acceptance into Season of Docs isn't a prerequisite for [becoming an Oppia contributor](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki). The Oppia project is run by the community for the community, and we warmly welcome anyone who'd like to help out!

# Season of Docs Proposal
**Important**: Please make sure that your final proposal is self-contained! In particular, to be fair to all applicants, key components of the proposal should not be editable after the deadline, and you shouldn't assume that reviewers will follow external links.

## Template
When submitting a proposal, please use the following template:
#### Project Details
* Name of the project.
* Why are you interested in working with Oppia?
* What interests you about this project?
* Project plan and implementation strategy. This is the most important section of the proposal.
* The platform you want to use for hosting the documentation

#### Other Commitments
* Which timezone(s) will you primarily be in during the implementation phase?
* How much time will you be able to commit to this project?

#### Communication
* What is your contact information, and preferred method of communication?
* How often, and through which channel(s), do you plan on communicating with your mentor?

## Tips for writing a good project plan

* **Milestones** that will divide your work into multiple parts, you can set milestones for each month or for each week. Strong proposals will have clear, concrete and measurable milestones, whose success can be objectively evaluated by an external observer.
