### Instructions
When writing design docs at Oppia, please consider using this [design doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMivKj5uWkOkj4AB684JVJslAe49gSskZ-VsyUjgPN4/edit). This will ensure that all the necessary information for the project is documented in a central location, and enable project reviews to be done effectively.

More specifically, here’s how to get started:

1. Make a copy of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMivKj5uWkOkj4AB684JVJslAe49gSskZ-VsyUjgPN4/edit).
2. Delete the top "instructions" box.
3. Fill in all the sections with details pertaining to your feature/project (you can remove the existing text, which is just meant to help you get started). For sections that are not required for the particular project you’re working on, write a short explanation of why they’re not required, rather than deleting them altogether.
4. Make sure to proofread your design doc before asking reviewers to look at it.

## How to respond to doc reviews

When you're responding to a reviewer's comments in a doc, we recommend that you treat it like [responding to a code review](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Contributing-code-to-Oppia#instructions-for-making-a-code-change). 

More specifically:
- Feel free to accept (or reject!) suggestions. If you reject a suggestion, that's fine, but say why.
- In general, treat comments similarly to how you would treat comments in a standard code review. In other words:
  - Before asking for a follow-up review, make sure to reply to each comment (maybe with "Done") and update the doc as needed, but **don't resolve the comment thread**. Let the reviewer handle that, so that they can keep track of which comments still need to be addressed. Sometimes, more follow-up might be needed when the reviewer looks at the updated version of the doc.
  - If you have any questions about the reviewer's comments, feel free to ask them for clarification.
