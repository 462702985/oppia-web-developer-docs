If your PR changes the properties of an exploration or state (or other structure), it should also include a migration so that existing entities in the datastore can be migrated smoothly to the new structural format. The following instructions describe how to write such a migration for states of explorations or questions.

## Steps to follow while writing state migrations
1. Make the necessary changes to the State class (or its descendant classes) to reflect the post-migration state structure.
2. Make the necessary changes to the NEW_STATE_TEMPLATE in the constants.js file to reflect the post-migration state dict structure.
3. Increment the CURRENT_STATES_SCHEMA_VERSION in the feconf.py file.
4. Increment the CURRENT_EXP_SCHEMA_VERSION in the exp_domain.py file and similar changes in the question_domain.py file.
5. Start with writing _convert_states_v(old_state_version)_dict_to_v(old_state_version + 1)_dict method in exp_domain.py files under Exploration class and in question_domain.py under Question class.
6. Changing existing test files:
   - Change core/tests/data/oppia-ThetitleforZIPdownloadhandlertest!-v2-gold.zip file with the updated schema.
   - Change the dict and yaml form of state in the following files wherever required:
     - core/controllers/editor_test.py
     - core/domain/exp_domain_test.py
     - core/domain/exp_services_test.py
     - core/domain/question_jobs_one_off_test.py
     - core/domain/QuestionObjectFactorySpec.js
     - core/domain/state_domain_test.py
     - core/tests/test_utils.py (Change the VERSION_(Old_version)_STATE_DICT to a new one)

7. Create a PR, if the tests fails try resolving the test issues.
8. Once your PR is finalized, create a new one-off job (ExplorationMigrationValidationJob) which will make changes to the dict of existing exploration model and validates that the migration will be successful.
9. Once the one-off job PR gets merged and the job result is successful, try updating your migration PR and deleting the one-off job (as this will not be required anymore).
10. Get your migration PR merged.

**Note:** These steps are for the migration where one is changing the schema of all existing states, depending on the changes your migration is going to make the steps will be less as youâ€™ll have to change very fewer test files.

If you find new test files where changes needed to be required, try updating the list.
