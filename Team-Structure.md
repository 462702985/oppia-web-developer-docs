## General notes on team structure

In order to streamline development efforts, many of the major projects in Oppia are organized as small development teams containing 2-5 members. The projects are listed in the [Projects](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/projects) page, and each team has a team lead who is responsible for the success of the project.

### Responsibilities of team leads

A team lead is a position of responsibility in the Oppia project, and it involves coordinating the efforts of a small team in order to improve a part of the site. This is a good way to get some experience in technical leadership. The duties of a team lead are as follows:

- Proactively keep your mentor updated on the progress/status of your project (at least weekly).
- Own the main design doc(s) for your project, and figure out (possibly with the guidance of your mentor) how to break your project into subprojects that can be worked on independently.
- Be the point of contact for new contributors who'd like to help with your project, and suggest things that they can do.
- Keep your GitHub project page organized!

### Mentors

Each team lead will have a mentor. Mentors are generally senior members of the Oppia development team, and their role includes the following:
- Providing feedback and support as needed.
- Providing advice on how to manage projects.
- Being available to answer questions that the team lead can't resolve on their own (e.g. because they need input from someone with a broader view of the codebase).

However, mentors are not meant to be bottlenecks, and do not have to approve all the decisions -- project leads are welcome to make and own decisions about things. Mentors are available, however, to answer significant questions that team leads need to escalate, and team leads should feel welcome to do this as needed.
