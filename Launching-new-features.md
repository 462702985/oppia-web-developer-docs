Procedure to apply for launching new features:

- Fill out this [google form](https://forms.gle/m2u1VkQDXWee4euAA).
- Nithesh will get back to you within 48 hours, along with an appropriate person to test the feature. There will also be a deployment done to the backup server where the feature will be tested.
- The tester will be given 1 week to file any issues they find.
- The bugs will need to be fixed before the target release. (Preferably before the release cut, but if it doesnâ€™t make it, then all the issues will be considered blockers for the release).
