As a lesson creator with Oppia, you will be creating content that will be delivered directly to students facing education inequality across the world. Ultimately, everything we do at Oppia is to help you create these effective lessons. This series of wiki pages will help you get started so that you can begin making an impact right away. 

<h2>Anatomy of an Oppia Lesson</h2>

Here is a list of terms that we’ll be using to describe the various parts of lessons:
* <b>Topic</b> - A topic, like Fractions, consists of one or more stories. Sometimes, more than one story may be needed to teach a topic fully.
* <b>Story</b> - A story is a group of explorations, and is the new name we’ll be giving to what are currently called “collections”. Each exploration in the same story follows the same story arc and shares the same setting/characters.
* <b>Exploration</b> **- This is a structured learning experience that is part of a story, and provides the learner with an active way to learn new concepts, as well as targeted feedback. It is the core unit of learning in Oppia.
* <b>Skill</b> - This is a concrete learning outcome that describes something that a learner should be able to do. It is usually stated in the form “Given X, compute/calculate/draw/etc. Y.” For example: “Given a fraction, identify its numerator.”
* <b>Concept Explanation</b> - This is a non-story-based explanation of how to perform a particular skill. It serves as a reference/reminder for students who may have encountered the skill before but forgotten how to carry it out.
* <b>Misconceptions</b> - This is a list of misconceptions that students often have about a particular skill. It is used by exploration authors to ensure that questions have a sufficient amount of targeted feedback.
* <b>Question</b> - This is a standalone question that may be used by students as part of a practice session.

<h2>High-Level Process Flow</h2>
This is the high-level process of how a lesson is created. When you complete each step, a senior reviewer on the team will work with you to review and finalize the work. Click on each item below to view the guideline and detail of each process:
<ol>
<li>Create the Math Skill Tree</li> 
<li>Develop a Story Outline</li>
<li>Build out the Skill Table - Errors, Remediation, Sample Questions, Development of the topic</li>
<li>Create the Script</li>
<li>Graphics and Implementation</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Contacts</h3>
For each lesson you create, you will be assigned a lesson coordinator who is there to help mentor you through the process. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to your coordinator or contact the team leads below: 
<ul>
<li>Joe Kaewbaidhoon (joeyannaphol@oppia.org), Lesson Creation Lead</li>
<li>Mark Halpin (markhalpin3@gmail.com), Story Content Advisor/Reviewer</li>
<li>Sean Lip (sean@seanlip.org), Math Content Advisor/Reviewer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skill Tree</h2>
<p>The most basic unit of an Oppia lesson is the skill. A skill is a concrete learning outcome that describes something that a learner should be able to do. It is usually stated in the form “Given X, compute/calculate/draw/etc. Y.” For example: “Given a fraction, identify its numerator.”
</p>
<p>
In this stage, the creator is advised to breakdown the topic into as many concrete skill as possible. The more skills we can generate for a topic, the easier it is to scaffold the skills and guide students towards a deeper understanding of a topic. Since this will be the backbone of your lesson, it is the most challenging, but important step.
</p>
<b>Scope:</b>
<ul>
<li>It is up to the creator to determine what skills should be in scope for a topic. During the review process, your reviewers may discuss why some skills are omitted or suggest additional skills. Creators are strongly encouraged to contribute to these discussions and rationalize with the review team.</li>
<li>As creators break down the topic, make sure to note any pre-requisite skills that may not be part of the topic scope.</li>
</ul>
<b>Format:</b>
<ul>
<li>The creator should arrange the skill in a logical manner - building from simpler skills to more complex ones</li>
<li>The creator should arrange relevant skills into groups called “lessons”</li>
<li>It is fine the skill tree in a bulleted list form</li>
<li>You may repeat similar skill in different lessons</li>
</ul>
<b>Inspiration and Tips:</b>
<ul>
<li>Look at how textbooks approach a topic. They sometimes do not break down the topic in the manner that we do, but it is a good starting point.</li>
<li>Think of complex questions that you would like the learners to solve then work backwards to find out what skills are needed to solve those questions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Story Outline Development</h2>
<p>The story component is what makes Oppia lessons so effective. Stories help learners stay engaged - learners relate to the characters and realize the important role that math can play in their lives.</p> 

<p>Usually, a topic will have one story that spans across different lessons. In this stage, you are drafting the high-level story for each lesson.</p>
